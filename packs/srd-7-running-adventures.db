Advice on adventure design is found later in this section.</p>\n<p><strong>Improvisation:</strong> In spite of the referee&rsquo;s preparation, it is impossible to predict every possible player action. Players will come up with ideas that the referee has not even considered. It is thus important for the referee to remain flexible and to roll with any unexpected turns the adventure might take!</p>\n<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> This book provides procedures for many common adventuring situations. These exist in order to aid the referee in running the game. However, the referee should feel free to adapt and add to these procedures during play, in order to keep the game moving.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance:</strong> The referee must maintain a fun balance of risk and reward.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Neutral_Judge\" class=\"mw-headline\">Neutral Judge</span></h2>\n<p>The referee must remain neutral in all things&mdash;neither on the side of the players nor against them.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-competitive:</strong> The game is not a competition, with the players attempting to defeat the referee, or vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Fairness:</strong> The rules of the game should be applied equally to player characters, monsters, and NPCs.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Arbiter_of_Rules\" class=\"mw-headline\">Arbiter of Rules</span></h2>\n<p>The referee must decide when and how to apply the rules of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Rulings:</strong> The rules of the game&mdash;including descriptions of magic items, spells, or monsters&rsquo; special abilities&mdash;do not cover all possible scenarios, so the referee must be ready to apply judgement to resolve any unexpected situations which arise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Resolving actions:</strong> When a player wishes to do something not covered by a standard rule, the referee must consider how to determine the outcome. Sometimes, the situation can be dealt with simply by deciding what would happen. Sometimes, the referee may require the player to make an ability check (see <a title=\"Checks, Damage, Saves\" href=\"https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Checks,_Damage,_Saves\">Ability Checks</a>) or a saving throw (see <a title=\"Checks, Damage, Saves\" href=\"https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Checks,_Damage,_Saves\">Saving Throws</a>) to determine what happens. Other times, the referee may judge the likelihood of the action succeeding (e.g. expressed as a percentage or X-in-6 chance), tell the player the chances, and let them decide whether to take the risk or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Disagreements:</strong> The players may not always agree with the referee&rsquo;s application of the rules of the game. When this happens, the group should (briefly!) discuss the point of disagreement and come to a decision. The referee is always the final arbiter in such cases and should ensure that the game does not get bogged down in long discussions about the rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Randomness:</strong> The referee should make judicious use of die rolls, random tables, etc. While these can add an element of fun and unpredictability to the game, overuse of randomness can also spoil an adventure by derailing it too much.&nbsp;</p>","img":"icons/svg/book.svg"}

If this has not happened, the referee may wish to increase the amount of treasure. If, on the other hand, most PCs have reached 3rd level in this time-frame, the referee might place less treasure or make monsters tougher.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast:</strong> For groups who prefer a game where characters advance quickly, the referee should place large treasure hoards. These should, however, be guarded by appropriately challenging monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow:</strong> For groups who prefer the game to focus on character development rather than high risk, the rate of advancement and the danger presented by monsters may be reduced.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Character_Knowledge\" class=\"mw-headline\">Character Knowledge</span></h2>\n<p>Attention must be paid to the distinction between what a player knows and what their PC knows. Players may at times act on information that their PC could not know. The referee may occasionally need to remind players of this and may even need to forbid certain actions.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Grudges\" class=\"mw-headline\">Grudges</span></h2>\n<p>Player characters may, through the course of play, naturally develop grudges or rivalries. This is especially a possibility when characters of opposite alignments adventure together. This is a natural and fun part of good role-playing. However, the referee should ensure that such grudges do not dominate play and spoil the adventure for others.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Maintaining_Challenge\" class=\"mw-headline\">Maintaining Challenge</span></h2>\n<p>It is important that the referee keep the game challenging, even when player characters have reached high levels and amassed great wealth and power.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical research:</strong> Spell-casting characters may attempt to create new spells and magic items. When this happens, the referee should pay very careful attention to game balance. Magic that is permanent, may be used without limit, does not allow a saving throw, or that increases in power with level can easily become imbalanced. If in doubt, one option is to allow a new spell or item to be tested for a period, under the proviso that it may need to be altered if it proves to imbalance play.</p>\n<p><strong>Special abilities:</strong> Players may sometimes try to find ways to gain special abilities and powers beyond their characters&rsquo; normal class abilities. The referee should be very careful when allowing this, as it can lead to imbalance. The guidelines for magical research, above, should be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Excess wealth:</strong> If the level of PC wealth has gotten out of hand, the referee may wish to find ways to take excess money away from characters. This should always be done in such a way as to present the player with a choice, for example: pay a local tax or become an outlaw?&nbsp;</p>","img":"icons/svg/book.svg","_id":"QVgj2B7HMaackKAm"}

Choose the Setting</span></h2>\n<p>Basic geography: Decide on the basic geography and climate of the region to be described: whether it primarily consists of mountains, forest, desert, etc. The size of the region should also be determined.</p>\n<p><strong>Milieu:</strong> At this stage, the nature of the milieu being detailed should also be considered: the general level of technology, availability of magic, presence of different monsters and intelligent races, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>New campaigns:</strong> When starting a new campaign, it is recommended to begin by detailing a small, self-contained area that can be expanded upon over time.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"2._Map_the_Region\" class=\"mw-headline\">2. Map the Region</span></h2>\n<p>Major terrain features: Using graph or hex paper, create a map of the wilderness area, marking on the major terrain features such as mountain ranges, rivers, seas, lakes, islands, forests, swamps, and so on. Real world maps may serve as inspiration as to the natural structure and relationship of terrain features.</p>\n<p><strong>Scale:</strong> Typically, a large scale map (24 miles per hex) is drawn first, followed by smaller scale maps (6 miles per hex) of certain areas, adding more detail.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"3._Locate_Human_Realms\" class=\"mw-headline\">3. Locate Human Realms</span></h2>\n<p>Mark the areas that are controlled by humans, bearing in mind the needs of human civilisation (rivers, farmland, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Government:</strong> Also note the ruler of each human-controlled area: a petty lord, a mighty king, a league of merchants, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Base town (see step 5):</strong> Is typically placed in one of these regions.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"4._Locate_Non-Human_Realms\" class=\"mw-headline\">4. Locate Non-Human Realms</span></h2>\n<p>Mark regions that are controlled by other intelligent species that exist in the setting (e.g. demihumans, monstrous races, and so on), taking their preferred environment and way of life into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Nomads:</strong> Some intelligent species may keep domains with well-defined boundaries while others may move around&mdash;hunting or raiding&mdash;within a more vaguely defined area.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters:</strong> The territories of significant, non-intelligent monsters may also be marked on the map at this stage.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"5._Place_the_Base_Town\" class=\"mw-headline\">5. Place the Base Town</span></h2>\n<p>Locate a base town for player characters on the map, typically close to a river or road near the centre of the map. This is where play will begin. The guidelines to the right may be used to help flesh out the base town.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"6._Place_Dungeons\" class=\"mw-headline\">6. Place Dungeons</span></h2>\n<p>Place one or more dungeons on the map, somewhere in the vicinity of the base town.</p>\n<p><strong>Distance:</strong> Dungeons are normally located around a day&rsquo;s journey from the base town&mdash;close enough that travel between the town and the dungeon is convenient, but not so close that the town is plagued by monsters from the dungeon.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"7._Create_Regional_Encounter_Tables\" class=\"mw-headline\">7.

The best way of achieving this is to only describe what characters see, hear, smell, and so on, without providing the players any additional information.</p>\n<p><strong>Monsters:</strong> Should be described, rather than referred to by name. Players will come to recognise different types of monsters by their descriptions and behaviours.</p>\n<p><strong>Surprise attacks:</strong> When characters are attacked by surprise, the referee should simply describe the attack itself, rather than giving players the complete description of the attacking monster. For example, a character may just see a clawed hand reaching out of the shadows. Only in subsequent combat rounds should a more detailed description of the monster be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Monster and NPC game stats:</strong> The game statistics (e.g. hit points, level) of monsters and NPCs should never be revealed to players. In combat, the referee should describe the effects of damage on a monster, rather than telling the players how many hit points it has remaining.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic items:</strong> Should be described, rather than referred to by name. Only by experimentation can players find out what powers a magic item has (and indeed whether an item is magical at all!).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Describing_Explored_Areas\" class=\"mw-headline\">Describing Explored Areas</span></h2>\n<p>The usual procedure is for the players to draw maps of areas being explored, based on the referee&rsquo;s descriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Squares:</strong> One way to speed up mapping is to specify dimensions (e.g. the width and length of rooms in a dungeon) in terms of map squares, rather than in feet. Of course, the referee and the players must agree on the size of one map square.</p>\n<p><strong>Known areas:</strong> Sometimes, characters may already know the shape of an area being explored. In this case, the referee may draw the parts of the map which are already known.</p>\n<p><strong>Complex areas:</strong> In the case of extremely complicated areas, the referee may draw directly on the players&rsquo; map. This is not generally to be encouraged, however, as this does not help the players to improve their own mapping skills.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Using_Miniatures\" class=\"mw-headline\">Using Miniatures</span></h2>\n<p>Some groups like to use miniatures along with a gridded tabletop surface to track exploration and combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Play surface:</strong> The most convenient type of surface is something on which maps can be drawn with erasable pens. The surface should be gridded for ease of tracking the movements of characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Scale:</strong> The typical scale used is 1&rdquo; on the play surface = 5&rsquo; in the game world (or 5 yards for outdoor encounters).</p>\n<p><strong>Miniatures:</strong> Miniature figures are available to purchase from many different companies. Alternatively, simple tokens like dice or beads can be used.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"icons/svg/book.svg","_id":"dk4LUhCrCca3Dkmu"}

This is the hook that draws the player characters to the adventure site, and provides a background theme that the referee can use to tie the location together. The scenario drives the referee&rsquo;s choices of specific traps, treasures, and monsters to be placed in the location. The following examples may be used for inspiration.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><span id=\"1._Banishing_Ancient_Evil\" class=\"mw-headline\">1. Banishing Ancient Evil</span></h2>\n<p>An evil presence (e.g. a monster or NPC) must be banished or destroyed. It may have been dormant for many years, and have only recently been awakened (perhaps as a result of another party&rsquo;s meddling).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"2._Clearing_Ruins\" class=\"mw-headline\">2. Clearing Ruins</span></h2>\n<p>Settlers plan to move into an abandoned settlement or stronghold. Before they arrive, the PCs need to scout the area and clear out any monsters or other dangers that are present. The ruins need not be in a remote area&mdash;they could even be within (or beneath) a major settlement.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"3._Contacting_a_Lost_Civilisation\" class=\"mw-headline\">3. Contacting a Lost Civilisation</span></h2>\n<p>The PCs discover a long-lost race in a fantastic location. They may have once been human, but are now adapted to their strange environment. For example, they may have reverted to bestial behaviour or may be adapted to subterranean life, with pale skin and infravision.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"4._Escaping_from_Captivity\" class=\"mw-headline\">4. Escaping from Captivity</span></h2>\n<p>The PCs have been taken prisoner by an enemy and begin the adventure in captivity, possibly with a grisly fate awaiting them in the near future. They must regain their freedom.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"5._Exploring_Unknown_Territory\" class=\"mw-headline\">5. Exploring Unknown Territory</span></h2>\n<p>An NPC hires the party to explore and map an unknown region. This may be a previously uncharted area or may be a recent alteration to a familiar region (e.g. a magic castle may appear in an empty plain).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"6._Performing_a_Quest\" class=\"mw-headline\">6. Performing a Quest</span></h2>\n<p>A deity or powerful NPC (e.g. a king) sends the PCs on a quest. This may involve recovering holy or magical items.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"7._Rescuing_Captives\" class=\"mw-headline\">7. Rescuing Captives</span></h2>\n<p>Important NPCs have been kidnapped by bandits, wicked monsters, or an evil wizard. The PCs attempt to rescue the prisoners, either seeking a reward or because of a personal connection with the unfortunate captives. It is also possible that the PCs may be hired as bodyguards to NPCs who are negotiating with the kidnappers.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"8._Scouting_an_Enemy_Outpost\" class=\"mw-headline\">8. Scouting an Enemy Outpost</span></h2>\n<p>An invasion is looming (or in progress)! The PCs are tasked with infiltrating an outpost of the enemy, gathering intelligence as to their plans, strengths, and weaknesses, and (if possible) destroying them.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"9._Seeking_a_Magical_Doorway\" class=\"mw-headline\">9. Seeking a Magical Doorway</span></h2>\n<p>A gateway exists that allows magical travel (either one-way or bidirectional) between distant locations or even other worlds. The PCs may be tasked with locating a lost portal or closing a portal used by enemies. The portal may also be the only means of travel to a fantastic destination that the PCs must visit.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"10._Visiting_a_Sacred_Site\" class=\"mw-headline\">10. Visiting a Sacred Site</span></h2>\n<p>In order to consult with an oracle, remove a curse, or find a holy relic, the PCs must journey to a sacred site (e.g. a shrine or temple). The exact location of the site is usually a matter of conjecture.&nbsp;</p>","img":"icons/svg/book.svg","_id":"ygbPHiqePb2nEASc"}
